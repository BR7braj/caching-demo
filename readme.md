## Caching Demo 

This is a api built using spring boot web starter and spring boot redis starter.
It uses caching to reduce response time for requests.

It uses Redis (Remote dicationary Sever) as the Inmemory Data Store of choice. Inmemory Datastore are way fatser than traditional databases as it stores the data in memory and avoids the cost of I/O opertions.

Latency is important criteria that needs to be considered while designing apis/ web services. Caching is one of the methods that can be deployed to solve latency issues.
